### Final Compiler (without Sourcemap)

sh media/templates/site/wwu-template/final_sass.sh

### SCSS

* Don't change scss in the vendor folder
* You can change everthing in media/templates/site/wwu-template/scss/wwu/
* If you want to start from scretch. Just comment out all content in the files and all no needed files in template.scss
* You can remove scss files and add new ones. For us is important, that the structure is easy readable for everyone (e.g. you need scss for a contact form -> create _contactform.scss; you need a global color -> use _variables.scss; you want to create a global styled box or button -> use _styles.scss; for small changes you can use the _main.scss). 
* you found this structure is bullshit? Tell us a better one and we are open to changes. :-)

## Favicon

* favicon.ico is located at the /media/templates/site/wwu-template/images/favicon...
* You can use png or ico. Both code-versions are in the templates index.php (.ico is commented out)

The error.php in the template folder automatically directs 404 requests there.
